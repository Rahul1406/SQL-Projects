# Online Retail Application Database
### Overview
As e-commerce experiences remarkable growth around the world, online retail application databases are among the most popular SQL project ideas. The application allows the customer to register and buy an item using the Internet. The registration process typically involves the generation of a unique customer ID and password and in many cases, consolidates information like Name, Address, Contact Information, Bank details, etc.

Once a user purchases a product, a bill is generated based on the quantity, price, and discount, if any. The customer has to choose a payment method to settle the transaction before it is delivered to the selected location.

Here are the Tables in the database:   
  - **Customers Table**: Stores information about customers such as their name, contact details, and login credentials.
  - **Products Table**: Stores information about products available for purchase, including their name, description, price, and stock quantity.
  - **Orders Table**: Stores information about each order made by customers, including the total amount, payment method, and delivery details.
  - **OrderItems Table**: Stores information about each item in an order, including the quantity, price, and any applicable discounts.
