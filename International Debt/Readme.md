# International Debt Analysis
## Project Overview

In this project, we will analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank using SQL in SQL Workbench. The dataset encompasses information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various categories. Our objective is to derive meaningful insights from this data by answering key questions related to the total debt, debt distribution among countries, and average debt across different indicators.

## Technology Used

For this analysis, we will utilize SQL (Structured Query Language) within SQL Workbench, a powerful tool for managing and querying databases. SQL will allow us to efficiently extract, manipulate, and analyze the data to uncover trends and patterns. SQL Workbench provides an intuitive interface to perform complex queries and visualize the results, making it an ideal choice for this project.

## Project Significance

Understanding international debt is crucial for assessing the economic health and stability of developing countries. By analyzing the debt data, we can gain insights into the financial burdens faced by these nations and identify potential areas of concern. This analysis can help policymakers, economists, and researchers to make informed decisions and develop strategies to manage and mitigate debt-related issues.

## Insights

Throughout this project, we aim to answer several critical questions, such as:
  1. Data set Overview.
  2. Number of Distinct Countries.
  3. Distinct debt indicators.
  4. Total amount of debt owed by the countries.
  5. Country with the highest debt.
  6. Average amount of debt across indicators.
  7. The highest amount of principal repayments.
  8. The most common debt indicator.
  9. Other viable debt issues and conclusion

By the end of this project, we expect to have a clearer understanding of the international debt landscape and be able to present our findings through detailed SQL queries. This project will not only enhance our SQL skills but also provide valuable insights into the financial challenges faced by developing countries.
